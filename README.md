# Final Project - Economectrics (MODS202)
This project was completed as part of the Econometrics course with Prof. Patrick Waelbroeck (2024–2025).
It applies econometric methods to both cross-sectional housing price data and time series macroeconomic data (GDP, unemployment, inflation) using Python.

### Project Overview
Cross-sectional analysis (housing price dataset HPRICE2):
- Hypothesis testing for OLS assumptions (unbiasedness, sample selection bias, omitted variable bias, multicollinearity).

- Regression models: linear and log-linear forms.

- Variable transformations, residual analysis, joint hypothesis testing.

Heteroskedasticity analysis:

- Tests for heteroskedasticity in multiple model specifications.

- Weighted Least Squares (WLS) to correct standard errors.

Time series analysis (1900–2000 dataset):

- Stationarity, ergodicity, and spurious regression.

- Unit root testing, ACF & PACF analysis.

- Regression with stationary variables.

- Autocorrelation testing and correction (GLS).

- Granger causality tests and structural stability/breakpoint analysis.
