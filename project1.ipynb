As a result, the sample was biased, as it did not account for the planes that were lost. The conclusion that reinforcing the areas with bullet holes was necessary was therefore incorrect, as the planes that returned were able to do so despite the damage, while the planes that were shot down likely had damage in different areas that were not observed. In reality, the researchers should have reinforced different areas of the plane's structure, since the sample was not representative of the full population of planes involved in the war effort. "

However, it cannot be asserted that this is a ceteris paribus effect because we do not know if the other variables are held constant, and a scatter plot alone is not sufficient. Moreover, it is possible to see that there are different prices for the same NOx level, indicating the likely presence of other variables influencing the price, which are therefore not constant."

In the first test, the F-value is 6.799; in the second, F is 19.98; and in the third, F is 18.27. The increment in the F-value is noteworthy because as it increases, it moves further away from the critical value, which remains constant at 1.95 for all tests.

The ACF is calculated for all possible lags and provides a complete picture of the correlation structure of the time series.  \n",
    "PACF (Partial Autocorrelation Function): The PACF measures the correlation between a time series and its lagged values, but it does so while controlling for the effects of intermediate lags. In other words, the PACF at lag $k$ represents the correlation between the series and its $k$-th lag after removing the influence of all shorter lags (1 through $k−1$)."

    "The principle of parsimony, often referred to as Ockham's razor, is a philosophical guideline that suggests when faced with multiple competing explanations or hypotheses, the one that makes the fewest assumptions should be selected. Essentially, among various hypotheses, the one that requires the least amount of assumptions is typically the most accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ockham's Razor**  \n",
    "Ockham's razor is a specific version of the principle of parsimony linked to the 14th-century English thinker William of Ockham. It emphasizes that one should not create more entities than necessary, meaning that unnecessary assumptions should be avoided. In practice, this often leads to a preference for simpler models over more complicated ones, especially when both can explain the data effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Information Criterion Theory**  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the realm of statistical modeling and information theory, the principle of parsimony can be evaluated using specific criteria, like the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) or the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). These criteria help assess and compare different statistical models based on how well they fit the data while also considering their complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Akaike Information Criterion** (AIC): The AIC is determined by the formula:  \n",
    "$$AIC=2k−2ln(L)$$  \n",
    "where $k$ represents the number of parameters in the model and $L$ is the likelihood of the model given the data. The AIC rewards models that fit the data well but also penalizes those that are overly complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bayesian Information Criterion** (BIC): The BIC is similar to the AIC but imposes a stronger penalty for the number of parameters:  \n",
    "$$BIC=ln(n)k−2ln(L)$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "where $n$ is the number of observations. The BIC tends to favor simpler models even more than the AIC, particularly as the sample size grows.\n",
    "\n",
    "The connection between the principle of parsimony, Ockham's razor, and information criteria can be explained like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Simplicity vs. Complexity: Both Ockham's razor and the principle of parsimony emphasize that simpler models or explanations are usually better. Information criteria like AIC and BIC put this idea into a mathematical context, helping to weigh the trade-off between how complex a model is and how well it fits the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Model Selection: When researchers use AIC or BIC, they are essentially applying Ockham's razor in a numerical way. They compare different models and choose the one with the lowest AIC or BIC score, which indicates it is the simplest model that still effectively describes the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Balancing Fit and Simplicity: Information criteria help to find a balance between how well a model fits the data and its complexity. This is at the heart of Ockham's razor: a model that fits the data too perfectly might be too complicated, making it less parsimonious and resulting in a higher AIC or BIC score.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the principles of parsimony and Ockham's razor steer the model selection process toward simpler options, while information criteria offer a solid method for numerically comparing models that embody these principles."

   "source": [
    "Auto-correlation of errors happens when the error terms in a regression model are linked to each other. This means that the errors from one time period rely on the errors from earlier periods, which goes against the idea that errors should be independent in regression analysis. When there is autocorrelation in the error terms, ordinary least squares (OLS) faces some problems. Even though the estimated regression coefficients are unbiased, they don't have the minimum variance property anymore. Moreover, the Mean Squared Error (MSE) can significantly underestimate the actual variance of the errors, and the standard error of the regression coefficients might greatly underestimate the real standard deviation. In these cases, the usual statistical intervals and inference methods may not be valid anymore."
